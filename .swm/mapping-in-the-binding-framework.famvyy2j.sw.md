# Overview of Mapping in the Binding Framework

Mapping in the Binding Framework is the process that connects source data to target data, enabling the transfer and transformation of information between objects. It is a fundamental mechanism that supports data synchronization and transformation within the framework.

# Core Interfaces and Concepts

The Mapping interface defines the contract for how data is mapped from one object to another. Implementations of this interface encapsulate the logic required to perform the mapping operation. When a mapping is executed, the outcome is captured by a MappingResult, which details the specifics of the mapping step, including whether it succeeded or encountered errors.

To manage complex binding operations involving multiple mappings, the framework uses MappingResults, a collection that aggregates individual MappingResult instances. This aggregation allows the framework and developers to track, inspect, and process the results of each mapping step comprehensively.

# Usage in the Codebase

Within the codebase, the Mapping interface is concretely implemented by classes such as DefaultMapping. This class handles the execution of mapping logic and supports type conversion through a configurable type conversion executor. Additionally, mapping is integrated with error handling classes like RequiredError and TypeConversionError, which represent specific failure scenarios encountered during mapping.

# Example: DefaultMapping Implementation

The DefaultMapping class demonstrates a practical implementation of the Mapping interface. It manages the mapping execution flow and incorporates type conversion capabilities to ensure that data types are correctly transformed during the mapping process. This design allows for flexible and robust data binding operations.
